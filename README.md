# trumpR

I initiated this project after learning the basics of R on DataCamp (#rstats). I had always thought downloading data from Twitter would be interesting so gave it a shot. 

The project required creating a developer profile with Twitter directly and then registering an app to gain access to their API. This script doesn't use the likely more streamlined twitteR package by Jeff Gentry because I thought doing it on my own would be a better learning experience. 

Many hours later, it was! The script is simple and probably rife with no-no's that veteran programmers would laugh at, but it represents my best efforts and does something I think is pretty cool. 

In sum, the script uses the httr package to query the Twitter API for a small subset of 2016 US presidential candidate Donald Trump's followers and plots their locations on a world map. Here is a glimpse at the final plot:

Thanks for taking a look.
